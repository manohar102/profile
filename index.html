            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m a Senior Software Engineer who loves building scalable, reliable, and user-centric systems. I’ve led initiatives across system design, architecture design, and performance tuning—always focused on creating solutions that are both technically solid and impactful for users. From mentoring teammates to collaborating with cross-functional groups, I thrive in roles where I can drive clarity, clean code, and continuous improvement. I enjoy solving complex problems, simplifying legacy systems, and turning feedback into features that matter. With a strong foundation in both backend and frontend development, I bring a balanced perspective to every project I take on.
