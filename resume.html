        <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
        <p>
            I'm a Senior Software Engineer who loves building scalable, reliable, and user-centric systems.
            I've led initiatives across system design, architecture design, and performance tuning—always focused on 
            creating solutions that are both technically solid and impactful for users. From mentoring teammates to 
            collaborating with cross-functional groups, I thrive in roles where I can drive clarity, clean code, and 
            continuous improvement. I enjoy solving complex problems, simplifying legacy systems, and turning feedback 
            into features that matter. With a strong foundation in both backend and frontend development, I bring a 
            balanced perspective to every project I take on.
